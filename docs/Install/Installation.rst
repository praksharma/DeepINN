Install and Setup
================

DeepINN is still in early development stage and isn't very useful at all. One can access the pre-release `here <https://github.com/praksharma/DeepINN/releases/tag/v0.1.0>`_.

DeepINN only supports `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ >1.9.0. You can clone the project repository as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/praksharma/DeepINN.git

We are also planning to release a Docker and an Apptainer container once the library is matured enough to solve simple inverse problems.
