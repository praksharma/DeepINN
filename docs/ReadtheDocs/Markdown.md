# A Markdown example

We can't preview a markdown file in RST preview too, so we need to download a separate makrdown preview tool in VS Code.

We can write code:

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3])
```

We can also use Latex I guess.

$$
u_{xx}=\alpha \frac{\partial u^2}{\partial ^2 x}
$$
